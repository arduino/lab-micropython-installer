# MicroPython Installer for Arduino

MicroPython Installer for Arduino is a cross-platform tool that streamlines the process of downloading and installing MicroPython firmware on compatible Arduino boards. It is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows and is built using the Electron framework.

## Features
- Automatic download of MicroPython firmware.
- Seamless installation process onto Arduino boards.
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows).

## System Requirements
There are no special system requirements for this tool beyond the prerequisites for running Electron applications.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/arduino/lab-micropython-installer.git

# Go into the repository
cd micropython-installer-arduino

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm run start
```

## Packaging

```bash
npm run make # Creates a distributable file
# or
npm run package # Creates a ready-to-run application
```

## Publishing

The CI takes care of making new releases. All that needs to be done is to bump the version with `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` and push the tags with `git push --follow-tags`. When the CI is down the release will be in draft state so you can add release notes and publish it.

To manually publish a new version, run:

```bash
npm run publish
```

## Usage
Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
Launch the application.
Follow the on-screen prompts to download and install the MicroPython firmware.
Supported Boards
A list of supported Arduino boards will be available soon.
